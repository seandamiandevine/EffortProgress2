- `analysis` contains all scripts for the behavioural analysis, including the fitting of HDDMs. 
- `power` contains scripts to conduct the simulation-based power analysis included in the supplmental materials of the paper. 
- `task` contains Python, JavaScript, and HTML code to administer the oddball task described in the paper locally (or with some tweaking, online). Note: This version of the task has other features that were not implemented in the version described in the paper, such as an adaptive deadline to be used during the baseline phase. Ignore this if you are merely trying to replicate our procedure, or contact me for any questions.
